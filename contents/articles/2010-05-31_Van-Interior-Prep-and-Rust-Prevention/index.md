How I prepped the interior of a cargo van for RV conversion.

1. Removed old cargo management system and divider wall
2. Removed plywood floor
3. Removed rust and screws from the interior floor with sandpaper, wire brushed, a grinder fitted with a flap sanding disc (this was awesomely effective)
4. Painted with Rustoleum's White Clean Metal Primer
